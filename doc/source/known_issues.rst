    - Workaround: Deploy chunks of up to 10 nodes or increase the delay-before-timeout in the plugin’s tasks.yaml file on the Fuel master node. If timeout occurs, click “deploy-changes” again


Issue 5
    - Description: Using an untagged storage network on the same interface with a private network over Ethernet is not supported when using iSER
    - Workaround: Use a separate interface for untagged storage networks for iSER over Ethernet or use a tagged storage network instead

    - Workaround: Ping from the Cinder target after the reboot to another machine in the cluster over the storage network. The VLAN storage network will be over vlan<vlan#> interface.
