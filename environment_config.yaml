      In order to use Mellanox High performance features, you have to complete the following prerequisites prior to the deployment:
        - For Ethernet deployment:
        *   Configure Switch ports to Ethernet mode.
        *   Configure the desired VLANs for each port.
        - For Infiniband deployment:
        *   Configure Switch ports to Infiniband mode.
        *   Configure a Subnet Manager (SM) on the switch or on a node in the cluster, as described in the User manual.
        *   Reboot bootstrap nodes with "reboot_bootstrap_nodes" script, from the Fuel master, in order to load EIPOIB HW discovery support.
        - After Mellanox interfaces discovery, Do not forget to do the following:
        *   Move the relevant networks to work over Mellanox ports in the interfaces configuration in the Nodes tab.
        *   Run network verification, after configuring the desired network subnets and VLAN segmentations.
